# Human Skin Lie Detector Circuit

## Project Overview

This project presents an electronic lie detector capable of providing two types of measurements: one for responses to difficult questions and another for indicating general emotional state. Emotional states are detected not only through increased heart rate and hand tremors, but also through increased skin moisture, which reduces skin resistance and triggers the lie detector circuit.

## Key Features

- **Powered by two 9V batteries**, to prevent interference with measurements  
- **Operational amplifier A1** for input signal amplification and separation  
- **Operational amplifier A2** configured as an integrator for auto-adjustment  
- **Fine adjustment** via potentiometer for calibration  

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following folders:

- `Bill_of_Materials` – List of components used (BOM)
- `Data Sheets` – Technical documentation for the components
- `Schematics` – Circuit schematic of the lie detector
- `Project Docs` – Project documentation:
  - Description of circuit operation  
  - Component calculations for optimal design

## Usage Instructions

### Circuit Simulation

Open the `.opj` file located in the `Schematics` folder using a compatible simulator such as OrCAD.

## Technical Requirements

- Required Software:
  - OrCAD 17.2 or OrCAD X for simulations
  - OrCAD 17.2 or OrCAD X for PCB design
